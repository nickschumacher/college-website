             <h2>What is Personalized Learning?</h2>
            <div class="what-is-content">
           
            <p class="what-is"> <br>Personalized Learning is an innovative online bachelors degree program that offers an innovative way to pursue a traditional education in a non traditional way.
            </p>
            
            <p class="what-is"><br>Personalized learning allows students to work at their own pace and choose the order in which they complete their lessons. This allows students to graduate earlier or later, depending on their peronal motivation and current life situation. Workers can spend their night earning a bachelors degree. Students can graduate faster and cheaper by working around the clock or whenever they have time.
            </p>
           
            <p class="what-is"><br>The cost of the degree program is on par with community college tuiton, which is perfect for students who are just starting to build their wealth. It is an exceptional bargain that offers a real degree backed by a world class university </p>
            
            <p class="what-is"><br>Unlike other online programs the degree is not designated with "distance learning", rather it appears identical to a traditional on campus degree. This means that in NAU's eyes the curriculum is equivalent in rigor to its on campus courses, therefore it deserves to be distinguished as such.
