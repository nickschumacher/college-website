        <p class="about-description"> My name is Nicholas Schumacher and this is a practice website that is part of the applied IT project at Northern Arizona University for the Personalized Learning program. The applied IT project is an opportunity for students to choose a project in various areas of IT such as web technologies, networking, databases, etc. My personal interests and career aspirations revolve around web technologies, specifically web development. Having said that I, thought an excellent application of the lessons taught in the Personalized Learning program would be in front end web development. My mentor agreed.</p>
        
        <p><br>This site will demonstrate many applications of web development practices and technologies. The website is primarily static with extensive utilization of html and css elements. I was initially going to stick with a static design but my mentor encouraged me to push myself and attempt to utilize some dynamic elements. These elements rely on jquery and consist of a dynamic google map, and archive expanding links. By implementing dynamic elements; I have learned some of the basics of jquery and javascript and will continue to explore and master these languages in my web development journey.</p>
        
        <p><br>In addition to dynamic elements this site features icons, various sections divided by background colors and whitespace, and the ever so frustrating placement of images. It will also feature a contact form. One innovative design approach that I had decided to incorporate was the use of a full screen background image. This is a trend that I have been noticing on modern websites and I was eager to implement it. Essentially the goal of this project is to try to incorporate many elements of css, html, and javascript to create a unique and beautiful website that is centered around the theme of personalized learning. </p>
